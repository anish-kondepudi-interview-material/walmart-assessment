**Movie Theater Seating Challenge - 2020**

**Language used:**  Python

**Assumptions:**

1. There will be sufficient seats for all individuals who have a reservation
2. There will never be a group that’s too large to fit within a single row
3. The reservation numbers are in sequential order i.e. R001, R002, R003,...

_Customer Satisfaction:_

1. Customers who make reservations as a group will be more satisfied if they sit next to each other
2. The middle seats give the best viewing experience, therefore customers who sit there will have the highest satisfaction

_Maximum Theater Utilization:_

1. To maximize theater utilization, we will try to put as many customers in the middle seats as possible while abiding by Covid-19 guidelines (Ties in group sizes will be determined by reservation order)
